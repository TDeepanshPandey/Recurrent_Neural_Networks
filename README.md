# Recurrent Neural Networks - LSTM (Python, Keras)

I have designed a recurrent neural network with four LSTM layer on Google Stock Price dataset from January 2012 to December 2016 then it used to predict the stockprice for January 2017. I have taken 60 days timesteps for my neural network and 50 neurons in every layer with a dropout of 20%. 

Dataset - The data is available online on Yahoo Finance but I have used the one provided with the course.
